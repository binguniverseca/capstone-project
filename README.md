# capstone-project
The current project aims to develop an Android fitness app, which provides a platform for fitness lovers to efficiently find training items and log their training activities. The main features include log-in, sign-up, fitness categories, workout logs, fitness videos and more. It allows users to log their exercise activities by click “start training”.
The app will be designed with minimal style for easy navigation. Users are able to browse through categories and have an overview about the fitness types. Users can start training once they choose the specific training activity.
